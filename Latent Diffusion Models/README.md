# Latent Diffusion Models
## Inpainting
The pretrained model is used for impainting. The input images, masks and their inpainting results are available in `data/Inpainting` folder.

## Finetuning
Stable diffusion model is fine-tuned using few images of Tollywood Actor Maheshbabu using DreamBooth tool.
